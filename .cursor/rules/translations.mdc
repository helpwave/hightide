# Overview

To add translations edit the corresponding file in the locales folder and follow these rules:
1. always add translations for all languages
2. Keep the keys sorted alphabetically
3. Use lower camel case for the translation
4. Prefix Selections with "s"
5. Prefix Plural Selections with "p" if the translation does not include the count and with "n" if it includes the count
6. Prefix Replacements with "r"
7. In case of both Selection and Replacement choose the Selection prefix
8. After adding all translations, run `npm run build-intl` to update the generated translation file
