description: Rules for adding translations and how to apply the update

# Overview

To add translations edit the corresponding file in the locales folder and follow these rules:
1. always add translations for all languages
2. Keep the keys sorted alphabetically
3. Use lower camel case for the translation
4. Prefix Selections with "s"
5. Prefix Plural Selections with "p" if the translation does not include the count and with "n" if it includes the count
6. Prefix Replacements with "r"
7. In case of both Selection and Replacement choose the Selection prefix
8. After adding all translations, run `npm run build-intl` to update the generated translation file

## ICU Message Type Prefixes

### Selection (prefix "s")
ICU `select` statements that choose between options based on a value:
- Example: `"sThemeMode": "{theme, select, dark{Dark} light{Light} system{System}}"`
- Example: `"sGender": "{gender, select, male{Male} female{Female} other{Other}}"`

### Plural Selection (prefix "p" or "n")
ICU `plural` statements for pluralization:
- **"p" prefix**: When the translation does NOT include the count number
  - Example: `"pThemes": "{count, plural, =1{Theme} other{Themes}}"`
- **"n" prefix**: When the translation DOES include the count (using `#` or `{count}`)
  - Example: `"nItems": "{count, plural, =1{# item} other{# items}}"`

### Replacement (prefix "r")
When there is text outside the ICU statement (before or after):
- Example: `"rSortingOrderAfter": "Applied {otherSortings, plural, ...}"`

### Combined Cases
If a translation has both Selection/Plural AND Replacement (text outside), use the Selection prefix (rule 7).

## Examples

**Correct:**
- `"clearValue": "Clear Value"` - simple string, no prefix
- `"sThemeMode": "{theme, select, ...}"` - selection, "s" prefix
- `"pThemes": "{count, plural, =1{Theme} other{Themes}}"` - plural without count, "p" prefix
- `"rSortingOrderAfter": "Applied {otherSortings, plural, ...}"` - replacement, "r" prefix

**Incorrect:**
- `"themeMode": "{theme, select, ...}"` - missing "s" prefix
- `"themes": "{count, plural, ...}"` - missing "p" prefix
